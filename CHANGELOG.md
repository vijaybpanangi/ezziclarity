# Changelog

Notable changes to the website, deployment configuration, and project documentation. The detailed history lives in git; this file curates the highlights so a casual reader can scan what's happened over time without scrolling commit logs.

### Infrastructure

- **`www.ezziclarity.ca` now resolves.** Added as a second Custom Domain on the Cloudflare Pages project. Previously the `www` subdomain returned HTTP 522 (Cloudflare reached an origin that wasn't responding); now both apex and `www` serve identical content from the same Pages deployment.

### Documentation

- **`README.md`** — public-facing project overview for anyone landing on the GitHub repo home (tagline, live URL, the three languages, what's in the box, how to preview and deploy, the two editing gotchas).
- **`CLAUDE.md`** — operator's manual for Claude Code sessions working in this repo: the WordPress-to-static origin, the triplicate en/fr/ar maintenance reality, French translated URL slugs (`a-propos`, `ressources`), Arabic RTL handling, the relative-path depth gotcha, the design system, and the per-page mobile-nav script duplication.
- **`docs/superpowers/` scaffold** with `specs/`, `plans/`, and a README explaining the brainstorm → spec → plan → execute workflow used on this project.
- **`.gitignore`** added — covers OS metadata, editor scratch, env files, and `.superpowers/` brainstorming-session artifacts.
- **GitHub About panel filled in** — description (`Trilingual (EN / FR / AR) marketing site for Ezzi Clarity, an Ontario educational consulting practice. Plain HTML + CSS, deployed on Cloudflare Pages.`), live website link (`ezziclarity.ca`), and topics tags (`multilingual-websites`, `marketing-site`, `static-site`, `canada`, `rtl`, `html-css`, `ontario`, `cloudflare-pages`, `educational-consulting`).
- **README and CLAUDE updated** to name `https://ezziclarity.ca` as the live URL and document the Cloudflare Pages auto-deploy from `main`.

### Deferred / known follow-ups

- **`www → apex` canonical redirect.** Both variants serve identical content, but no single canonical URL is chosen yet. A Cloudflare Redirect Rule (match `Hostname equals www.ezziclarity.ca`, static target `https://ezziclarity.ca`, preserve path + query, status 301) would close this. Polish, not a fix.

## Earlier

The site began as a WordPress theme. It was converted to static HTML/CSS/assets and committed as `Initial upload` — PHP and the WP runtime are no longer required. The original conversion note lives at `README_STATIC.txt`. The CSS file header still carries WordPress theme metadata (`Theme Name: Ezzi Clarity, Version: 8.5.0`) as a harmless leftover.

DNS curiosity worth knowing: the apex has `SPF` and `DMARC` TXT records pointing at `_spf.wpcloud.com`. These are legacy from the WordPress.com hosting era and exist to authenticate any email originating from the domain. Leave them alone unless asked.
